Below is an **example console session** demonstrating a **step-by-step** solution for the classic Sudoku puzzle you provided. It includes **both valid moves** (which the game accepts) and **invalid moves** (which the game rejects). This illustrates how the user might interact with the Sudoku program, and how the puzzle updates or reports errors accordingly.

> **Important Note**: The exact moves and sequence can vary—there are many ways to solve a Sudoku. The following transcript is just one illustrative path, mixing manual solves, an invalid attempt, and eventually leading to the final solution.

## Initial Puzzle

Upon starting, the Sudoku program displays the board (using dots `.` for empty cells):

```
-------------------------------------
5 3 . | . 7 . | . . .
6 . . | 1 9 5 | . . .
. 9 8 | . . . | . 6 .
-------------------------------------
8 . . | . 6 . | . . 3
4 . . | 8 . 3 | . . 1
7 . . | . 2 . | . . 6
-------------------------------------
. 6 . | . . . | 2 8 .
. . . | 4 1 9 | . . 5
. . . | . 8 . | . 7 9
-------------------------------------

1) Enter a move
2) Solve automatically
3) Load puzzle from file
4) Save current puzzle to file
5) Exit
Choice:
```

*(Rows and columns are 1-based in user input, but the program converts to 0-based internally.)*

---

## 1) Attempting an Invalid Move (Out of Range Row)

**User Input**:
```
Choice: 1
Enter row (1-9), column (1-9), and value (1-9): 10 1 7
```
**Program Output**:
```
Row must be between 1 and 9.
```
*(The program rejects it and returns to the menu loop without altering the puzzle.)*

---

## 2) Attempting an Invalid Move (Sudoku Rule Violation)

**User Input**:
```
Choice: 1
Enter row (1-9), column (1-9), and value (1-9): 1 2 5
```
- The user is trying to place `5` at Row=1, Col=2. But Row=1, Col=1 already contains a 5. This move **breaks** Sudoku rules.

**Program Output**:
```
Invalid move. That cell might be occupied or the placement breaks Sudoku rules.
```
*(Again, the board does not change. We see the menu again.)*

---

## 3) Placing a Valid Move

**User Input**:
```
Choice: 1
Enter row (1-9), column (1-9), and value (1-9): 1 3 4
```
- Row=1, Col=3 is empty, and `4` does not violate row, column, or box constraints.

**Program Output**:
```
Move accepted!
```
Then the puzzle re-displays:

```
-------------------------------------
5 3 4 | . 7 . | . . .
6 . . | 1 9 5 | . . .
. 9 8 | . . . | . 6 .
-------------------------------------
8 . . | . 6 . | . . 3
4 . . | 8 . 3 | . . 1
7 . . | . 2 . | . . 6
-------------------------------------
. 6 . | . . . | 2 8 .
. . . | 4 1 9 | . . 5
. . . | . 8 . | . 7 9
-------------------------------------

1) Enter a move
2) Solve automatically
3) Load puzzle from file
4) Save current puzzle to file
5) Exit
Choice:
```

## 4) More Valid Moves (Manually Solving)

Below is an example sequence of a few more valid moves. (In a real game, the user might consult Sudoku logic or guess-and-check. Here, we pick correct placements directly.)

### 4.1 Place 2 in Row=1, Col=4

**User Input**:
```
Choice: 1
Enter row (1-9), column (1-9), and value (1-9): 1 4 2
```
**Program Output**:
```
Move accepted!
```
Updated board (Row=1, Col=4 now has `2`):
```
-------------------------------------
5 3 4 | 2 7 . | . . .
6 . . | 1 9 5 | . . .
. 9 8 | . . . | . 6 .
-------------------------------------
8 . . | . 6 . | . . 3
4 . . | 8 . 3 | . . 1
7 . . | . 2 . | . . 6
-------------------------------------
. 6 . | . . . | 2 8 .
. . . | 4 1 9 | . . 5
. . . | . 8 . | . 7 9
-------------------------------------
```

### 4.2 Place 9 in Row=1, Col=7

**User Input**:
```
Choice: 1
Enter row (1-9), column (1-9), and value (1-9): 1 7 9
```
**Program Output**:
```
Move accepted!
```
Updated first row: `5 3 4 2 7 . 9 . .`

---

### 4.3 Several More Moves

*(For brevity, we’ll list them in quick succession. Each is a correct placement. The program would accept each and reprint the puzzle. We won’t show the entire board after each small move, but imagine it gradually filling up.)*

- **R2 C2 = 7**  (Enter row=2, col=2, value=7)
- **R9 C1 = 3**  (Enter row=9, col=1, value=3)
- **R2 C9 = 8**  (Enter row=2, col=9, value=8)
- **R9 C5 = 8**  (Enter row=9, col=5, value=8)
- … and so on.

After each valid move:
```
Move accepted!
```
The board updates, showing fewer and fewer dots.

---

## 5) An Invalid Move Attempt Midway

Let’s say the user attempts:
```
Choice: 1
Enter row (1-9), column (1-9), and value (1-9): 1 5 3
```
But that cell is already `7`, so it’s **occupied**. The program will say:
```
Invalid move. That cell might be occupied or the placement breaks Sudoku rules.
```

---

## 6) Eventually Solve the Puzzle

If the user keeps making the correct placements, eventually all 81 cells fill up. For instance, a fully solved board for this puzzle is:

```
-------------------------------------
5 3 4 | 2 7 6 | 9 1 8
6 7 2 | 1 9 5 | 4 3 .   <-- Suppose we haven't placed the last digit yet
1 9 8 | . . . | . 6 .   
-------------------------------------
8 . . | . 6 . | . . 3
4 . . | 8 . 3 | . . 1
7 . . | . 2 . | . . 6
-------------------------------------
. 6 . | . . . | 2 8 .
. . . | 4 1 9 | . . 5
. . . | . 8 . | . 7 9
-------------------------------------
```
(We continue until each row, column, and 3×3 box is valid with digits 1–9.)

### 6.1 Or Use the Automatic Solver

At any time, the user can pick:
```
Choice: 2
```
**Program Output**:
```
Puzzle solved!
-------------------------------------
5 3 4 | 2 7 6 | 9 1 8
6 7 2 | 1 9 5 | 4 3 ...
1 9 8 | ...   | ... etc.
-------------------------------------
```
*(The solver backfills all remaining empty spots correctly. You’d see the entire 9×9 completed.)*

Once solved, you might see a message:
```
Great job! The Sudoku is solved!
```

---

## 7) Saving & Exiting

The user can then:

```
Choice: 4
Enter filename to save puzzle to: mySolution.txt
Puzzle saved to mySolution.txt!
```
Then:
```
Choice: 5
```
*(Program exits.)*
